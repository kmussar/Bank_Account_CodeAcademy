# Bank_Account_CodeAcademy
This is a simple excercise demonstrating classes and objects. It is modeled after a bank account. The methods included are: accepting deposits and withdrawls, showing the balance, and showing the name of the account. Included are checks to make sure that funds are available in the account before they can be removed.
